Database Storage

### Decision
No database storage needed because our calculator doesn't need to store any data.

### Rationale
Our app is just doing calculations on the fly, so there's no need to save anything.

### Consequences
This simplifies things for us because we don't have to worry about managing any data storage or encryption.
