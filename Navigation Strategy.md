Navigation Strategy

### Decision
We'll use **React Navigation** for moving around in our app.

### Rationale
React Navigation is pretty popular and it's easy to use. Plus, it's got a lot of different navigation patterns we can use.

### Consequences
This should give us a solid navigation system for our app. But we'll need to make sure everyone on the team knows how to use React Navigation.
