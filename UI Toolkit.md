UI Toolkit

### Decision
We're going with **React Native Elements** for our UI toolkit.

### Rationale
React Native Elements has a bunch of pre-built components which will help us get this app up and running faster.

### Consequences
This means we can focus more on making the app work rather than making it look good. But we might be a bit limited by the design options in the toolkit.
